# My-PyChess
A Multiplayer/SinglePlayer Chess app written in Python using Pygame Library.

## Welcome to PyChess!
This is a python app purely created from scratch using just Python(version 3.7.x) and Pygame.

This game does not support Python 2.
Python 3.5 till Python 3.7.6 supported and tested, may even work on Python 3.3 and 3.4 .
It even needs a roughly recent version of pygame to work.

To run the game, download the file and run the main.py file.
Choose from the menus options.

If you choose multiplayer, you will see the chess board appear. Go ahead and enjoy the chess match with your friend.
Singleplayer is a random move generator for beginners.
Harder levels of difficulty coming soon.
You can save/load games.

If you take a look at the source code, you can observe that Object Oriented Programming style has not been used.

To explain in short- how the logic works in the chess game,
- Pygame provides the tools for GUI and mouse motion handling.
- There are 2 lists that hold the position of each piece.
- The functions are written, each with a specific use to handle data and play chess.
- This encorporates almost all the features of chess(except en-passant).

Feel free to download the code, use it and please notify me if you come across bugs and glitches.

## How to customise the game Using Preferences
- In the main game menu(You see this after running main.py), click preferences.
- Here you have a few settings(more coming soon).
1) Animations: When this is True, it will show the pieces that you move to slide smoothly(recommended to be True always, look better).
2) Sound: When this is True, it will play sounds(recommended to be False for now, I am working on it)(a placeholder for future upgrade).
3) SlideShow: When this is True, it will show a slideshow of images on main menu (recommended to be True always, look better).
4) Show moves: When this is True, it will show all legal move options for a selected piece during gameplay (recommended to be True, highly helpful for beginners (my favourite feature)).
5) Undo: When this is True, it allows users to undo(recommended to be True)(a placeholder for future upgrade).
6) Border color: RGB colour Code for chess board borders.
7) Screen size: Size of the screen (a placeholder for future upgrade).

- RE-RUN THE GAME TO APPLY NEW SETTINGS.
- You can also open preferences.txt and edit the file there (not recommended to do unless you know what you are doing, it might spoil the app if you do it the wrong way).
